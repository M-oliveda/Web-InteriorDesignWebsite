# Web Development Project: Interior Design

![Hero Image](./interior-design.png)

This website is a **learning project website** I created to test my **web tech** skills. And also for people to see my development skills and experience.

First, the project will use an already designed project I found on [Figma templates.](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1228449606225720762/interior-website-design-services-page)

For the development of this project, I will use **core website technologies** plus a CSS framework called [Bulma.](https://bulma.io/)

Also, This project will use a popular module bundler, [vite.](https://vitejs.dev/)

This project is developed under an **open-source software license.** Feel free to comment or send a personal message for details or other information.

## Build instructions

To install all the software dependencies, run:

```cli
    yarn install
```

To build the project for development purposes, starting a local server, run:

```cli
    yarn vite:dev
```

To build the project for production (minifying source codes), run:

```cli
    yarn vite:prod
```

I recommend you check the `package.json` files to see more tools, libraries and other CLI commands related to this project.
